## Trouble shooting

1. Change directory of data in all .sh file and also preprocess.py along with post_process.py file.

2. Combine downloaded data and generate data in original repository

3. nltk download punct

4. pyc file reconpile? otherwise conda environment

5. Remember to delete args.log if it raise the error "... exist in args.log"

6. Attention modeule returns a named tuple



## Implementation

- [x] Decoder attention over Interation, Column HeadersS 

- [ ] Utterance Encoder co-attention

- [ ] Interaction Encoder co-attention

- [ ] Table Encoder co-attention

- [ ] (IP) Utterance-Table BERT embedding as input to bi-lstm in encoders. (for utterance now only)
